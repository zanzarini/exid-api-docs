## 2. Core Endpoints

### 2.1 POST /api/create-session  â€” Start Verification

This is the **only endpoint that incurs a cost** when the verification is successfully created.

#### ðŸ”¹ Key Feature: Project Tracking (`vendor_data`)

Use the `vendor_data` field to uniquely identify the source of the verification  
(e.g., a specific website, app version, or internal project ID).  
This allows tracking and filtering of transactions in your dashboard.

#### Requirements
- You must have sufficient **Credit Balance** (in USD cents).  
- The `workflow_id` must match an active service plan.

| `vendor_data` | String | âœ… | Your control string for tracking projects, sites, or campaigns. |
| `callback` | URL | âœ… | The URL where the EX ID system will send the final result. |
